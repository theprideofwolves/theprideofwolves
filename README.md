Hello, there!

I am Bhanu Prathap Shourya V, someone who is unapologetically stubborn about being kind.

I like building things that are simple, useful, and naturally secure from the start. Pentesting taught me how things break, so now I focus on designing them better.
I experiment with tools and small applications I think should exist, and I document the process as I go.

 - I build small security tools and secure-by-design applications. 
 - I am currently learning how real teams ship secure products and applying
   that mindset. 
 - I love filmmaking and writing obsessively.

Thank you.

-V
